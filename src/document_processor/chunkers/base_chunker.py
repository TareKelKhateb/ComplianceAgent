    Abstract base class (interface) for all chunking strategies.

    Every chunker receives the full Markdown text produced by an extractor and
    returns a list of chunk dicts. The pipeline orchestrator depends only on this

        Split a full Markdown document into a list of structured chunk dicts.

        Args:
            full_text (str): The complete Markdown string from the extractor.
            doc_id (str):    The database ID of the parent document, embedded in
